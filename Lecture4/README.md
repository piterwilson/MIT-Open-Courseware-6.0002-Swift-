# Lecture 4: Stochastic thinking

Starting this Lecture I have begun to use [TensorFlow for Swift](https://www.tensorflow.org/), instead of pure Swift playgrounds. 

This will allow me to achieve a middle ground between the flexibility and pre-built libraries existing in `Python` and using `Swift`, a language I use for my everyday work and wich I am very familiar with.

Of special interest for me it will be to explore the exact limits of the [Python interoperability](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/tutorials/python_interoperability) capabilities.

## Example Lecture4-rollDie

This quick sample goes trough the simple dice roll demonstrated in the first part of the video lecture. I created a few different versions just to test Python interoperability with Swift. 

## Example Lecture4-Birthdays

Quick sample with the estimated probability of a shared birthdate.
