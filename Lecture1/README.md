# Lecture 1: Introduction and Optimization Problems

This code example implements a "greedy" algorithm that attempts to find a solution to the "knapsack" problem as explained in https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/lecture-videos/lecture-1-introduction-and-optimization-problems/

In the end is pretty clear, "greedy" can only find a local optimal solution.
