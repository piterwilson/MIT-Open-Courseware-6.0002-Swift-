# MIT-Open-Courseware-6.0002-Swift-
This repository contains my personal notes while following MIT Open Courseware 6.0002, with code exercises converted from Python to Swift

## Why convert from Python to Swift?
I am not very familiar with Python and find it useful to translate from one language to the other as a way to REALLY understand what is happening. 
Python is very loosely typed and sometimes that makes things a bit confusing to figure out specially if a new concept if being introduced. 
Swift is a fun language to write AND it provides strict types which makes things more organized and easier to reason about. I don't claim either is better than the other! It has to do with my background more than anything else.

## Swift for Tensorflow

Starting Lecture 4 I am using **Swift for Tensorflow** projects (https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/). I came accross this component while researching the proper way to bring Python libraries to Swift.
